# Website_blocker
A very basic website blocker, that is able to block websites that are distracting during times for work

This came around as my wife asked if i was able to create something simple to block websites like facebook during working hours,
this script is made to be able to run quietly in the background and block websites using the hosts file. The blocking
will be lifted when "fun time" is commenced which is after the time specified which is outside of work hours

This can be activated using task scheduler and run on bootup.
